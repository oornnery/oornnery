### Hi, I‚Äôm @oornnery üëã

VoIP Engineer at IDT Brasil working across SIP, networking, Python 3 backend with FastAPI, DevOps, and security, with a terminal-first workflow on Arch Linux + Hyprland
Passionate about building TUI tools, protocol tooling, and automation for large-scale voice/data environments, always keeping things reproducible and minimal on Linux

### What I build üöÄ

- Maintaining icmpx: a didactic ICMP toolkit for ping/traceroute experiments and network diagnostics in Python 3
- Maintaining sipx: a didactic SIP library with registration, dialogs, and call control for VoIP flows
- Maintaining yealink-manager: helpers for provisioning and device management workflows in Yealink environments
- Dotfiles: reproducible, terminal-first setup for Linux with Hyprland and friends
- TUI apps with Textual for SSH-like sessions, chat components, and autocomplete

### Telecom and support üì°

- Technical support for SIP Trunk/Link, PABX, and Call Center, handling provisioning, routing, and troubleshooting end to end
- Ticket and incident workflows using JIRA, Salesforce, and BA (Abnormality Bulletin) for call management
- Configuration and maintenance of voice and data equipment across heterogeneous environments
- Service monitoring with Zabbix, Grafana, VoIP Monitor, and Hepic for quality and availability
- Log analysis with Splunk and PCAP focusing on SIP, TDM/VoIP, DTMF, and SDP for root-cause analysis

### Development and tech üß©

- Backend: Python 3, FastAPI, async I/O, APIs, VoIP metrics (ASR, ACD, PDD) and observability
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, and JavaScript for operational interfaces and admin tools
- DevOps: containerized deployments with Docker/Podman and reproducible environments
- Linux: system administration and dotfiles-driven workflows on Arch Linux btw + Hyprland

### Highlights ‚≠ê

- Async SIP client with registration, dialogs, and call control for didactic call flows
- TUI apps that emulate SSH sessions and enhance operator ergonomics in the terminal-first stack
- VoIP analytics dashboards for SBCs and POP monitoring with SPL-based insights

### Training and automation üéì

- Conducting product/service webinars and internal enablement to scale team knowledge
- Implementing automation that reduces toil and accelerates incident response and provisioning
